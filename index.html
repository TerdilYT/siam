<h3>Pitching Statistics</h3>
<p>
  This program was coded in Python and tries to take input from raw input data and convert it into a table.
  <br>
  If I have time I will add a conversion function as for now data such as ERA needs to be pre-calculated and fed in.

<h3>Wettspiel</h3>
<p>This program was coded in Java and is based on random numbers which can be used as a gambling game. Examples are Flip and Roulette.
  <br>
  I will add more games because we are dealing with probability in Maths class. This gives me the chance to add dice games, lottery games, etc.

<h3>WM 2022 Tippspiel</h3>
<p>This website was created by me and 3 others. One person was in charge of the design, one in charge of the data entries and getting the data for the SQL Database and me and a group partner were in <br>
  the role of Full-Stack developers, in charge of Frontend and Backend including the user system, the betting system and leaderboards.
  <br>
  This project required knowledge of SQL, PHP, HTML and CSS. It helped to understand how the frontend relies on backend functions.
